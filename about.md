*My pronouns are they/them.*

My name is Jun, and I am a software developer turned biologist. My interest is in **ecological modelling**, **interdisciplinary conservation**, and their intersection in the **co-design of quantitative models with local communities** and application of such models to inform action that **supports the lives of both humans and more-than-humans**. I am particularly interested in **plants** and **novel ecosystems**.

I am a first-year PhD student in the [Intelligent Earth Centre for Doctoral Training](https://intelligent-earth.ox.ac.uk/home) programme at the University of Oxford, funded by [UK Research and Innovation](https://www.ukri.org/). My current research interest is in the use of **machine learning** for **causal inference in complex ecological datasets** and **quantification of uncertainty in ecological forecasts**. For these problems, I am planning to apply methods such as **recurrent neural networks** & **neural differential equations** for time-series predictions, **graph neural networks** for predicting changes in ecological interaction networks, and **explainable AI methods** to develop ecological models with both predictive power and interpretability for inference.

**Bryophytes** first inspired me to study biology, and I continue to enjoy my visits to their small but beautiful worlds. I am a member of the [British Bryological Society](https://www.britishbryologicalsociety.org.uk/), from where I have gained much of my bryological knowledge.

Please feel free to contact me to talk about anything from **research** and **public engagement ideas** to potential **artwork commissions**! I am active on the citizen science platform [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/yjkiwilee) and always happy to help with your observations, particularly bryophytes. Just tag me (@yjkiwilee) in a comment!
