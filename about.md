*My pronouns are they/them.*

My name is Jun, and I am a software developer turned biologist. My interest is in **ecological modelling**, **interdisciplinary conservation**, and their intersection in the **co-design of quantitative models with local communities** and application of such models to inform action that **supports the lives of both humans and more-than-humans**. I am particularly interested in **plants** and **novel ecosystems**.

I am an integrated master's student in Biology at the University of Oxford developing a [thesis project](/research/) quantifying **life stage-dependent interaction** between plants and modelling the impact of such stage-dependence on **community dynamics** and **coexistence**. I am supervised by [Dr Christina Hernández](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/christina-hernandez) and [Dr Roberto Salguero-Gómez](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/rob-salguero-gomez) in the [SalGo Team](https://www.salgo.ox.ac.uk/), and collaborating with [Prof Benjamin Blonder](https://benjaminblonder.org/people/principal-investigator/) at UC Berkeley and [Dr Courtenay Ray](https://courtenayray.com/) at the University of Wyoming.

I am the current Vice President and previous President of the **[Oxford University Nature Conservation Society](https://oxconsocorg.wordpress.com/)** (OUNCS) ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/oxfordconservationsoc/)), a student-led society that aims to **promote learning in conservation** and **engage students with the local community for conservation action**.

**Bryophytes** first inspired me to study biology, and I continue to enjoy my visits to their small but beautiful worlds. I am a member of the [British Bryological Society](https://www.britishbryologicalsociety.org.uk/), from where I have gained much of my bryological knowledge.

Please feel free to contact me to talk about anything from **research** and **public engagement ideas** to potential **artwork commissions**! I am active on the citizen science platform [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/yjkiwilee) and always happy to help with your observations, particularly bryophytes. Just tag me (@yjkiwilee) in a comment!
