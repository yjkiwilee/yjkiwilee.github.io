My name is Jun, and I am a biologist with a background in computer science. My interest is in **ecological modelling**, **interdisciplinary conservation**, and their intersection in the **co-design of quantitative models with local communities** and application of such models to inform action that **supports the lives of both humans and more-than-humans**. I am particularly interested in **plants** and **novel ecosystems**.

I am currently an MBiol integrated master's student at the University of Oxford, developing a [thesis project](/research/) quantifying **life stage-dependent interaction** between plants and modelling the impact of such stage-dependence on **community dynamics** and **coexistence**. This project has been motivated by "**organism's-eye view**" approaches to ecological modelling, which considers ecological variation between individuals in answering questions at larger scales of populations and communities. I am supervised by [Dr Christina Hernández](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/christina-hernandez) and [Dr Roberto Salguero-Gómez](https://www.biology.ox.ac.uk/people/rob-salguero-gomez) in the [SalGo Team](https://www.salgo.ox.ac.uk/), and collaborating with [Prof Benjamin Blonder](https://benjaminblonder.org/people/principal-investigator/) at UC Berkeley and [Dr Courtenay Ray](https://courtenayray.com/) at the University of Wyoming.

I am the current Vice President and previous President of the **[Oxford University Nature Conservation Society](https://oxconsocorg.wordpress.com/)** (OUNCS) ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/oxfordconservationsoc/)). The OUNCS is a student-led society that aims to **promote learning opportunities** in the critical and highly multidisciplinary field of conservation by hosting free expert talks and **engage members of the University with community conservation groups** and the invaluable work they are leading to protect local biodiversity. I've had many roles in three years that I have been involved with the society, from managing our public-facing **social media accounts** and supporting our **Biodiversity Garden project** on University-owned land, to initiating conversations with guest **speakers with diverse expertise** including ecological research, activism, wildlife filmmaking, environmental law and governance.

**Digital art** has been an important medium through which I express my impressions of nature and communicate science with a wider audience. I enjoy drawing **personal works** with [landscapes, plants and animals](/art/), and **illustrated articles** for the student-run journal [The Earthly](https://theearthly.co.uk) on a range of topics including [permafrost melting](https://theearthly.co.uk/2022/10/04/whats-happening-to-permafrost/), [natural capital](https://theearthly.co.uk/2023/09/17/natural-capital-is-ecosystem-valuation-really-the-solution/), [ocean acidification](https://theearthly.co.uk/2022/11/09/climate-changes-evil-twin-ocean-acidification-explained/) and [water scarcity](https://theearthly.co.uk/2023/06/05/where-did-all-the-water-go/). I am also starting to create art to [add narrative to my own research](/2024/12/08/bes-presentation/).

**Bryophytes** first inspired me to study biology, and I continue to enjoy my visits to their small but beautiful worlds ever since my proper introduction given by the lovely bryologists in the [British Bryological Society](https://www.britishbryologicalsociety.org.uk/). I am always looking for any opportunity to spread the love with more people. I am active on the citizen science platform [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/yjkiwilee) and **always happy to help with any bryophyte identification** - just remember to @ me in a comment!
