Visual art, and particularly digital art, has been an important medium through which I express my inspirations from nature and communicate science with a wider audience.

I have illustrated articles for the student-run journal [The Earthly](https://theearthly.co.uk) on topics such as [permafrost melting](https://theearthly.co.uk/2022/10/04/whats-happening-to-permafrost/), [natural capital](https://theearthly.co.uk/2023/09/17/natural-capital-is-ecosystem-valuation-really-the-solution/) and [water scarcity](https://theearthly.co.uk/2023/06/05/where-did-all-the-water-go/). I am also starting to use art to [add narrative to my research](/2024/12/08/bes-presentation/).
