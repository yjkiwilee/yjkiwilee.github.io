I have always been fascinated by software development as a tool to **create and explore virtual worlds**. I have development experience across a broad range of areas, including front and back-end web development, app development, large language model tool development in Python, and data analysis / ecological model simulations using R.

Below are some programming projects that I have been involved with.

### fall(sss)

*2020 - Current*

*See this project [here](https://fallsss.xyz/).*

Directed by artist [Yoojin Lee](https://www.nijooy.com/) and accompanied by her audio piece and drawing, fall(sss) explores the theme of falling and decline. The gradually shifting colourfield reflects the movement of the sun at a designated location; a digital sky that lightens and darkens in likeness to the sky above us. Please see [here](https://www.nijooy.com/fallsss/) for more information on this work.

### Drone on Earth

*2019*

*See this project [here](/droneonearth/) (mobile not supported).*

The 3D landscape in this project is rendered with spatial elevation data in Seoul, South Korea and stars at accurate positions for the time of day. This independent project imagines a scenario where you are exploring a familiar but barren terrain under a brilliant night sky with a low-flying drone. Is this our Earth? Can we find a sense of belonging in this simulated landscape?
