Sharing science and love of our living world is not only important, but also fun!

Being involved with the student-led [Oxford University Nature Conservation Society](https://oxconsocorg.wordpress.com/) (OUNCS) has been an invaluable opportunity for me to take part in public engagement for conservation together with our amazing committee members. We work to **promote learning in conservation** by hosting free expert talks, **contribute to local conservation efforts** by collaborating with community groups, and provide a **platform** for like-minded students to network and access information about careers in conservation. If you are based in Oxford, **follow us on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/oxfordconservationsoc/) to keep up to date about our events**!

Here are some exciting activities outside the OUNCS which I have been fortunate to be a part of.

- Developing a datapack that allows control of custom wild animals' movement for the [My Critter Snap](https://mycrittersnap.com/) project, which aims to teach wildlife camera trapping to citizen science participants using the popular 3D sandbox game Minecraft
- Delivered a **public talk** about bryophytes at the [Water and Wildlife Activity Day](https://www.oumnh.ox.ac.uk/event/water-and-wildlife-discovery-day) at the Oxford University Botanic Garden
- Guided **nature walks** as part of the Oxford Outside event run by the Environmental Sustainability Team at Oxford University
- **Illustrated articles** for the student-run journal [The Earthly](https://theearthly.co.uk) on a range of topics including [permafrost melting](https://theearthly.co.uk/2022/10/04/whats-happening-to-permafrost/), [natural capital](https://theearthly.co.uk/2023/09/17/natural-capital-is-ecosystem-valuation-really-the-solution/) and [water scarcity](https://theearthly.co.uk/2023/06/05/where-did-all-the-water-go/)

If you have an idea for public engagement related to **ecology**, **botany** and/or **conservation**, please reach out so we can discuss it further!
