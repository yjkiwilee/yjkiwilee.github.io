### Stage-dependent competition and its impact on coexistence

*2024 - Current*

**Do plant interactions depend on the actor & recipient's life stage?**<br>
**What impact does stage-dependence have on community dynamics and coexistence?**

Given ontogenetic niche shift, it is expected that the strength and nature of biotic interactions will depend on the interacting organisms' life stage. Despite theoretical work suggesting that stage-dependent interactions could e.g. affect community stability & diversity ([de Roos, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2023709118)), it remains to be explored (1) **whether interactions are stage-dependent** in empirical communities and (2) how altering stage-dependent interaction effects on specific vital rates could impact **transient/stochastic community dynamics** and the conditions for **long-term coexistence**.

In my master's reserach project, I am investigating these two questions through a combination of statistical analysis on **long-term demographic data from a herbaceous plant community** and simulation approaches using a **two-species stage-structured competition model**.
