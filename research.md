### Research projects

#### Quantifying stage-dependent competition and its impact on stochastic community dynaimcs

*2024 - 2025*

**Do plant interactions depend on the actor & recipient's life stage?**<br>
**What impact does stage-dependence have on stochastic community dynaimcs?**

Given ontogenetic niche shift, it is expected that the strength and nature of biotic interactions will depend on the interacting organisms' life stage. Despite theoretical work suggesting that stage-dependent interactions could e.g. affect community stability & diversity ([de Roos, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2023709118)), it remains to be explored:

1. **Whether biotic interactions are stage-dependent** in empirical communities
2. How altering stage-dependent interaction effects on specific vital rates could impact **stochastic community dynamics**.

In my master's reserach project, I investigated these two questions through a combination of statistical analysis on **long-term demographic data from an alpine herbaceous plant community** and simulation approaches using a **two-species stage-structured competition model**.

For each of my two research questions, I found that:

1. Biotic interactions, and therefore stage dependence, was **not statistically significant** in the empirical community
2. In the present simulation, **little variation in the stage structure of populations** lead to **minimal impact of stage dependence** on stochastic community dynamics.

Overall, these results suggest that **quantifying stage-specific biotic interactions may not be necessary** for accurate projection of stochastic community dynamics. This work is currently under publication.
